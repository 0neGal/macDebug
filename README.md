# macDebug
### A simple debugging tool for Mac machines.

macDebug is a simple tool that is made to make it easier to debug a mac machine, it is able to give you information such as how long the battery will take to charge or deplete, it can also give you a list on every shutdown and reboot done on your machine.

Not to mention it can give you info about what drives/partitions are mounted, the network card and many more things, all able to be generated with one script.

Now you could get all this information manually in macOS but if you want a simpler solution that is easier and faster to do macDebug got you covered. This tool is mostly aimed at people fixing or debugging a mac machine, such as a company that repairs or prepares computers, or troubleshoots them, instead of them having to enter many commands just to find out the ETA on the battery or having to have the computer turned on and see how long it lasts you can now just see it with one command, and there is much more infromatin included.

## Whats in macDebug right now?

Currently you can get many pieces of information about the machine some more useful then other.
But as a highlight you can see the ETA on the battery, device name and UUID history of shutdowns and reboots.

## Whats getting added in macDebug?

Right now it is only planned to make it the output file better to look at.
Since right now it just has a weird matrix like look with green text and monospace font.
This will only be temporary until I change it.

## How do I use macDebug?

When you download one of the releases there will be a README.pdf file with information on how to install it to a flash drive, and how to use the various commands macDebug comes with, in general it should take 1-5 minutes to get it working on a flash drive if not less.
